# Import

## Overview

In general Terraform supports the *import* of resources into the Terraform state. You find the official documentation on how to achieve this [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import).

The Terraform provider for SAP BTP supports the import of resources as well. [The documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/SAP/btp/latest/docs) of the Terraform provider for SAP BTP provides the necessary information on how to import a resource and which keys to use on the level of each resource.

To get a quick overview of the resources and if they support the import functionality, you can refer to the [Resource Overview](#resource-overview) section in this document.
