## Get Started

If you're not familiar with Terraform yet, see the [Fundamentals](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/cli) section with a lot of helpful tutorials. 

To learn how to use this provider, see the [Get Started with the Terraform Provider for SAP BTP](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/btp-terraform-get-started.html) tutorial in the SAP Developer Center.

## Best Practices

For the best experience using the {{.RenderedProviderName}} provider, we recommend applying the common best practices for Terraform adoption as described in the Hashicorp documentation. For example, see [Phases of Terraform Adoption](https://developer.hashicorp.com/well-architected-framework/operational-excellence/operational-excellence-terraform-maturity).

## Authentication

The {{.RenderedProviderName}} provider offers the authentication via `username` and `password`. Be aware that this authentication is not compatible with the SAP Universal ID. For details on how to resolve this please see SAP Note [3085908 - Getting an error (e.g. invalid credentials) in certain applications (e.g. SAP Download Manager) when using S-user ID or SAP Universal ID](https://me.sap.com/notes/3085908). 

## Custom User-Agent Information

By default, the underlying BTP client used by the Terraform BTP Provider creates requests with User-Agent headers that include information about Terraform and BTP Terraform provider versions. To add more details to the User-Agent headers, the `BTP_APPEND_USER_AGENT` environment variable can be set, and its value will be and its value will be directly added to HTTP requests. E.g.,

```bash
% export BTP_APPEND_USER_AGENT="Optional_Extra_Information"
```

## Single Sign On

The provider supports login via Single Sign-On (SSO) as well. To enable this you need to set the environment variable `BTP_ENABLE_SSO` to `true`. Additionally, ensure that you run your scripts in a desktop environment. It's important to note that the SSO login feature is not intended for use in containerized environments or CI/CD pipelines.
