  You can create up to five levels of directories in your account hierarchy. If you have directories, you can still create subaccounts directly under your global account.
  Tips:
  * You must be assigned to the global account admin role, or the directory admin if the directory is configured to manage its authorizations.
  * A directory path in the account hierarchy can have only one directory that is enabled with the ENTITLEMENTS or AUTHORIZATIONS features. If such a directory exists, other directories in that path can only be enabled with the DEFAULT features.

# btp_directory (Resource)

Directories allow you to organize and manage your subaccounts according to your technical and business needs. The use of directories is optional.

You can create up to five levels of directories in your account hierarchy. If you have directories, you can still create subaccounts directly under your global account.

__Tips:__
* You must be assigned to the global account admin role, or the directory admin if the directory is configured to manage its authorizations.
* A directory path in the account hierarchy can have only one directory that is enabled with the `ENTITLEMENTS` or `AUTHORIZATIONS` features. If such a directory exists, other directories in that path can only be enabled with the `DEFAULT` features.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "btp_directory" "parent" {
  name        = "my-parent-directory"
  description = "This is a parent directory."
}

resource "btp_directory" "child" {
  parent_id = btp_directory.parent.id
  name        = "my-child-directory"
  description = "This is a child directory."
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The display name of the directory.

- `description` (String) A description of the directory.
- `parent_id` (String) The GUID of the directory's parent entity. Typically this is the global account.
- `subdomain` (String) Applies only to directories that have the user authorization management feature enabled. The subdomain becomes part of the path used to access the authorization tenant of the directory. It has to be unique within the defined region.

### Read-Only

- `created_by` (String) Details of the user that created the directory.

- `features` (Set of String) The features that are enabled for the directory. Possible values are: 
	 - `DEFAULT` All directories have the following basic feature enabled: 
		 1. Group and filter subaccounts for reports and filters 
		 2. Monitor usage and costs on a directory level (costs only available for contracts that use the consumption-based commercial model)
		 3. Set custom properties and tags to the directory for identification and reporting purposes.
	 - `ENTITLEMENTS` Allows the assignment of a quota for services and applications to the directory from the global account quota for distribution to the subaccounts under this directory.
	 - `AUTHORIZATIONS` Allows the assignment of users as administrators or viewers of this directory. You must apply this feature in combination with the `ENTITLEMENTS` feature.
- `id` (String) The ID of the directory.
- `labels` (Map of Set of String) Contains information about the labels assigned to a specified global account. Labels are represented in a JSON array of key-value pairs; each key has up to 10 corresponding values.
