## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a secret type API credential at the globalaccount level
resource "btp_globalaccount_api_credential" "with-secret" {
  name = "globalaccount-api-credential-with-secret"
  read_only = false
}

# Create a certificate type API credential at the globalaccount level
resource "btp_globalaccount_api_credential" "with-certificate" {
  name = "globalaccount-api-credential-with-certificate"
  certificate_passed = "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n-not-a-valid-certificate-\n-----END CERTIFICATE----\n"
  read_only = false
}

# Create a secret type, read-only API credential at the globalaccount level
resource "btp_globalaccount_api_credential" "read-only" {
  name = "read-only-globalaccount-api-credential"
  read_only = true
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `certificate_passed` (String) If the user prefers to use a certificate, they must provide the certificate value in PEM format "----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...-----END CERTIFICATE-----".
- `name` (String) The name for the API credential.
- `read_only` (Boolean) Access restriction placed on the API credential. If set to true, the resource has only read-only access. Note that if a read-only credential is deleted, it will take a while to reflect in the global account.

### Read-Only

- `api_url` (String) The URL to be used to make the API calls.
- `certificate_received` (String) The certificate that is computed based on the one passed by the user.
- `client_id` (String) A unique ID associated with the API credential.
- `client_secret` (String) If the certificate is omitted, then a unique secret is generated for the API credential.
- `credential_type` (String) The supported credential types are Secrets (Default) or Certificates.
- `globalaccount_id` (String) The ID of the globalaccount.
- `key` (String) RSA key generated if the API credential is created with a certificate.
- `token_url` (String) The URL to be used to fetch the access token to make use of the XSUAA REST APIs.
