## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a secret type API credential at the directory level
resource "btp_directory_api_credential" "with-secret" {
  name         = "directory-api-credential-with-secret"
  directory_id = "d1298936-ddaf-4a82-b1d7-3ad29a732b61"
  read_only    = false
}


# Create a certificate type API credential at the directory level
resource "btp_directory_api_credential" "with-certificate" {
  name               = "directory-api-credential-with-certificate"
  directory_id       = "d1298936-ddaf-4a82-b1d7-3ad29a732b61"
  certificate_passed = "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n-not-a-valid-certificate-\n-----END CERTIFICATE----\n"
  read_only          = false
}

# Create a secret type, read-only API credential at the directory level
resource "btp_directory_api_credential" "read-only" {
  name         = "read-only-directory-api-credential"
  directory_id = "d1298936-ddaf-4a82-b1d7-3ad29a732b61"
  read_only    = true
}
