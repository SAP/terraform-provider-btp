## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a secret type API credential at the directory level
resource "btp_directory_api_credential" "with-secret" {
  name = "directory-api-credential-with-secret"
  directory_id = "d1298936-ddaf-4a82-b1d7-3ad29a732b61"
  read_only = false
}

// This datasource runs a go script to dynamically generate a PEM certificate which is used in the resource below
data "external" "values" {
  program = ["go","run","../certificate.go"]
}

# Create a certificate type API credential at the directory level
resource "btp_directory_api_credential" "with-certificate" {
  name = "directory-api-credential-with-certificate"
  directory_id = "d1298936-ddaf-4a82-b1d7-3ad29a732b61"
  certificate_passed = data.external.values.result["certificate"]
  read_only = false
}

# Create a secret type, read-only API credential at the directory level
resource "btp_directory_api_credential" "read-only" {
  name = "read-only-directory-api-credential"
  directory_id = "d1298936-ddaf-4a82-b1d7-3ad29a732b61"
  read_only = true
}
```

- `name` (String) The name for the API credential.
- `read_only` (Boolean) Access restriction placed on the API credential. If set to true, the resource has only read-only access.

### Read-Only

- `api_url` (String) The URL to be used to make the API calls.
- `certificate_received` (String) The certificate that is computed based on the one passed by the user.
- `client_id` (String) A unique ID associated with the API credential.
- `client_secret` (String) If the certificate is omitted, then a unique secret is generated for the API credential.
- `credential_type` (String) The supported credential types are Secrets (Default) or Certificates.
- `key` (String) RSA key generated if the API credential is created with a certificate.
- `token_url` (String) The URL to be used to fetch the access token to make use of the XSUAA REST APIs.
