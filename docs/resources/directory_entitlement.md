## Example Usage

```terraform
# entitle service plan without quota in a directory
resource "btp_directory_entitlement" "alert_notification_service" {
  directory_id = "6aa64c2f-38c1-49a9-b2e8-cf9fea769b7f"
  service_name  = "alert-notification"
  plan_name     = "free"
}

# entitle service plan with quota in a directory
resource "btp_directory_entitlement" "uas_reporting" {
  directory_id = "6aa64c2f-38c1-49a9-b2e8-cf9fea769b7f"
  service_name  = "uas"
  plan_name     = "reporting-directory"
  amount        = 1
}

# entitle service plan with distribution and auto assignment in a directory
resource "btp_directory_entitlement" "uas_reporting" {
  directory_id = "6aa64c2f-38c1-49a9-b2e8-cf9fea769b7f"
  service_name  = "alert-notification"

## Schema

### Required

- `directory_id` (String) The ID of the directory.
- `plan_name` (String) The name of the entitled service plan.
- `service_name` (String) The name of the entitled service.

### Optional

- `amount` (Number) The quota assigned to the directory.
- `auto_assign` (Boolean) Determines whether the plans of entitlements that have a numeric quota with the amount specified in `auto_distribute_amount` are automatically allocated to any new subaccount that is added to the directory in the future. For entitlements without a numeric quota, it shows if the plan are assigned to any new subaccount that is added to the directory in the future (`auto_distribute_amount` is not needed). If the `distribute` parameter is set, the same assignment is also made to all subaccounts currently in the directory. Entitlements are subject to available quota in the directory.
- `auto_distribute_amount` (Number) The quota of the specified plan automatically allocated to any new subaccount that is created in the future in the directory. When applying this option, `auto_assign` and/or `distribute` must also be set. Applies only to entitlements that have a numeric quota.
- `distribute` (Boolean) Defines the assignment of the plan with the quota specified in `auto_distribute_amount` to subaccounts currently located in the specified directory. For entitlements without a numeric quota, the plan is assigned to the subaccounts currently located in the directory (`auto_distribute_amount` is not needed). When applying this option, `auto_assign` must also be set.

### Read-Only

- `category` (String) The current state of the entitlement. Possible values are: 
 
  | value | description | 
  | --- | --- | 
  | `PLATFORM` |  A service required for using a specific platform; for example, Application Runtime is required for the Cloud Foundry platform. | 
  | `SERVICE` | A commercial or technical service. that has a numeric quota (amount) when entitled or assigned to a resource. When assigning entitlements of this type, use the 'amount' option. | 
  | `ELASTIC_SERVICE` | A commercial or technical service that has no numeric quota (amount) when entitled or assigned to a resource. Generally this type of service can be as many times as needed when enabled, but may in some cases be restricted by the service owner. | 
  | `ELASTIC_LIMITED` | An elastic service that can be enabled for only one subaccount per global account. | 
  | `APPLICATION` | A multitenant application to which consumers can subscribe. As opposed to applications defined as a 'QUOTA_BASED_APPLICATION', these applications do not have a numeric quota and are simply enabled or disabled as entitlements per subaccount. | 
  | `QUOTA_BASED_APPLICATION` | A multitenant application to which consumers can subscribe. As opposed to applications defined as 'APPLICATION', these applications have an numeric quota that limits consumer usage of the subscribed application per subaccount. | 
  | `ENVIRONMENT` |  An environment service; for example, Cloud Foundry. |
- `id` (String) The ID of the entitled service plan.
- `plan_id` (String) The ID of the entitled service plan.
