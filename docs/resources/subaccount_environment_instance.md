## Example Usage

```terraform
# creates a cloud foundry environment in a given account

  # ATTENTION: some regions offer multiple environments of a kind and you must explicitly select the target environment in which
  # the instance shall be created using the parameter landscape label. 
  # available environments can be looked up using the btp_subaccount_environments datasource
  parameters = jsonencode({
