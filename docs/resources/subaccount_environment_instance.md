## Example Usage

```terraform
# creates a cloudfoundry environment in a given account and grant the orchestration user admin access to it
data "btp_whoami" "me" {}
resource "btp_subaccount_environment_instance" "cloudfoundry" {
  subaccount_id    = "6aa64c2f-38c1-49a9-b2e8-cf9fea769b7f"
  name             = "my-cf-environment"
  environment_type = "cloudfoundry"
  service_name     = "cloudfoundry"
  plan_name        = "standard"

  # some regions offer multiple environments of a kind and you must explicitly select the target environment in which
  # the instance shall be created. 
  # available environments can be looked up using the btp_subaccount_environments datasource
  parameters = jsonencode({
    instance_name = "my-cf-org-name"
    users = [
      {
        id    = data.btp_whoami.me.id
        email = data.btp_whoami.me.email
