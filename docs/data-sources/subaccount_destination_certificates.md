# btp_subaccount_destination_certificates (Data Source)

Gets all the destination certificates in a subaccount.
		
		__Tip:__
		You must be assigned the Destination Admin role in the subaccount.

		__Further Information:__
		<https://help.sap.com/docs/connectivity/sap-btp-connectivity-cf/use-destination-certificates>

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Subaccount specific Destination Certificates
data "btp_subaccount_destination_certificates" "all" {
    subaccount_id = "6aa64c2f-38c1-49a9-b2e8-cf9fea769b7f"            
}

# Both Subaccount and Service Instance specific Destination Certificates
data "btp_subaccount_destination_certificates" "all" {
    subaccount_id = "6aa64c2f-38c1-49a9-b2e8-cf9fea769b7f"    
    service_instance_id = "bc8a216f-1184-49dc-b4b4-17cfe2828965"
