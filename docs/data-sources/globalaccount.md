The customer can still access their global account until the end of the validation period. * <b>SUSPENDED:</b> For enterprise accounts, specifies that the customer's global account is currently in the grace period of the termination process. Access to the global account by the customer is blocked. No data is deleted until the deletion date is reached at the end of the grace period.
