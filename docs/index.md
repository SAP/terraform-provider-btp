# Terraform Provider for SAP BTP

The Terraform provider for SAP BTP enables you to automate the provisioning, management, and configuration of resources on [SAP Business Technology Platform](https://account.hana.ondemand.com/). By leveraging this provider, you can simplify and streamline the deployment and maintenance of BTP services and applications.

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    btp = {
      source  = "SAP/btp"
      version = "0.6.0-beta2"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the BTP Provider
provider "btp" {
  globalaccount = "my-global-account-subdomain"
}
```

## Get Started

If you're not familiar with Terraform yet, see the [Fundamentals](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/cli) section with a lot of helpful tutorials. 

To learn how to use this provider, see the [Get Started with the Terraform Provider for SAP BTP](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/btp-terraform-get-started.html) tutorial in the SAP Developer Center.

## Best Practices

For the best experience using the SAP BTP provider, we recommend applying the common best practices for Terraform adoption as described in the Hashicorp documentation. For example, see [Phases of Terraform Adoption](https://developer.hashicorp.com/well-architected-framework/operational-excellence/operational-excellence-terraform-maturity).

## Authentication

The SAP BTP provider offers the authentication via `username` and `password`. Be aware that this authentication is not compatible with the SAP Universal ID. For details on how to resolve this please see SAP Note [3085908 - Getting an error (e.g. invalid credentials) in certain applications (e.g. SAP Download Manager) when using S-user ID or SAP Universal ID](https://me.sap.com/notes/3085908).
