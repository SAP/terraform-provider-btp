# Terraform Provider for SAP BTP

The Terraform provider for SAP BTP enables you to automate the provisioning, management, and configuration of resources on [SAP Business Technology Platform](https://account.hana.ondemand.com/). By leveraging this provider, you can simplify and streamline the deployment and maintenance of BTP services and applications.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    btp = {
      source  = "SAP/btp"
      version = "0.1.0-beta1"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the BTP Provider
provider "btp" {
  globalaccount = "my-global-account-subdomain"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `globalaccount` (String) The subdomain of the global account in which you want to manage resources. To be found in the cockpit, in the global account view.

### Optional

- `cli_server_url` (String) The URL of the BTP CLI server (e.g. `https://cpcli.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com`).
- `idp` (String) The identity provider to be used for authentication (default: `sap.default`).
- `password` (String, Sensitive) Your password. Note that if two-factor authentication is enabled, concatenate your password, followed by the passcode, in a single string.
- `username` (String) Your user name, usually an e-mail address.

## Get Started

If you're not familiar with Terraform yet, see the [Fundamentals](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/cli) section with a lot of helpful tutorials. 

To install the provider, create a Terraform configuration file `provider.tf` with the example above as content and execute `terraform init`. 

Then you can create *.tf files for the resources and execute `terraform plan` and, if everything looks fine, execute `terraform apply`.

## Best Practices

For the best experience using the SAP BTP provider, we recommend applying the common best practices for Terraform adoption as described in the Hashicorp documentation. For example, see [Phases of Terraform Adoption](https://developer.hashicorp.com/well-architected-framework/operational-excellence/operational-excellence-terraform-maturity).
