 * Accounts Service
 *
 * The Accounts service provides REST APIs that are responsible for the management of global accounts, and the creation and management of directories, subaccounts, and their custom properties/tags.  Global accounts represent a business entity and contain contract information, including customer details and purchased entitlements. The global account is the context for billing each customer.  Use the subaccount APIs to structure your global account according to your organization's and project's requirements regarding members, authorizations, and quotas. This service also provides you with APIs for creating and managing directories. While the use of directories is optional, they allow you to further organize and manage your subaccounts according to your specific technical and business needs. The service also lets you manage the custom properties/tags that you associate with your directories and subaccounts. NOTE: These APIs are relevant only for cloud management tools feature set B. For details and information about whether this applies to your global account, see [Cloud Management Tools - Feature Set Overview](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/caf4e4e23aef4666ad8f125af393dfb2.html).
